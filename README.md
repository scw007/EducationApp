EducationApp
============

 This was an app made for Hack Duke 2013. The idea is for the parent to give their kid their phone and let them play educational games. When they finish a track, it sends an email to the parent based on how well they're doing.
 
 Due to the 24 hour limit to the hackathon there's obviously some things we never got done...
 
 -You can't enter a parent email anywhere.
 
 -Right now you'll probably crash when you complete a track. The reason is that I took out my SendGrid login. Theres a limit to the emails for my free account, so you'll have to put your own in before you can send emails.
 
 -It'll probably crash if you aren't connected to the internet when you complete a track. Try moving all the sendgrid stuff into the try statement, I never got around to due to the 24 hr thing.
 
 -Doesn't play nice in landscape.
 
 -Won't let you adjust media volume while in the app when tested on my phone.
